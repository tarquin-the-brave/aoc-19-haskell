# day7

* used State monad in anger!
* needed to test more regularly in smaller chunks.
* before next puzzle:
  * turn on some extra comiler warnings
  * use tests for small bits
* I was stuck for ages in an "off by one" error.
* I tried to use a NonEmpty List for the phases but handling it was being a bit of a faff.
  * I'm still working out how best to encode safety.
    * It seems unecessary safety causes faff in the code.
